Input:
The program will ask me which day it is. Maybe Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday. I will choose one.

Then it will ask me, “From 1 to 10, what is your mood number today?” I will type the number.

Then it say, “Ask me anything.” I can write one short note about my day, like “exam today” or “went to gym.”

Output:
The program can show report. Maybe one type is weekly mood number only.

Another type is journal that show my short note from each day. 

The output can also be save in one file, like .txt file, so I can see later.
