# MoodTracker
ðŸ§  Mood Tracker

This project will be called Mood Tracker.
It will help me record my emotions every day and understand myself better.

Sometimes I feel not confident or a bit lonely, and my emotion changes a lot.
By writing mood scores and short notes, I will be able to discover some patterns and know what influences my feelings.

The program will be written in Python and will run in the terminal.
It will use modules such as matplotlib for making graphs and json for saving data.

I hope this project can support me to manage my emotions better and keep a more balanced mind in the future.
