# MoodTracker

This prototype is for track my mood everyday, from 1 to 10.  
I can also write small note about what happen that day if I want.  
At the end of the week, I can see all my mood and notes together.  
I hope by doing this I can understand myself more, like why I feel good or bad.

## WHY

I am new international student, I leave my home country, new language and new culture.  
Sometimes I feel lonely, and my eating is not good, I eat too much sugar, I sleep too late.  
Sometimes I don't even notice this, it just happen.  
I hear a quote said “you cant grow things you don't measure.”  
So I think I want to grow my emotion, and I make this small program to track how I feel each day.  
If I can see the pattern, maybe I can know what make me happy or not good, and then I can change.

# How to run the program

To start the program in terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

main.python main.py

Some important command:

1. Command + C to exit the code
2. clear to clear the terminal

# Folder Structure

- documentations folder
  - reference.md
  - idea.txt

Explain:

- documentations (learning notes and references, not code)

  - reference.md (all tutorial links and documentation I used)
  - idea.txt (first idea and plan when starting project)
  - I will add AI acknowlegdement later

- drafts (Not working) (early test code and failed versions)

  - experiments (test code for each function)
    - mood.py (test mood data logic)
    - input.py (test input function)
    - plot.py (test matplotlib plotting)
    - save.py (test saving files)
  - 1.py (early version 1)
  - 2.py (early version 2)
  - 3.py (early version 3)

- main.py (final working code of the project)
- README.md (explain project, why and how to run it)
- requirements.txt (list python libraries to install before running)
