# MoodTracker

This prototype is for track my mood everyday, from 1 to 10.  
I can also write small note about what happen that day if I want.  
At the end of the week, I can see all my mood and notes together.  
I hope by doing this I can understand myself more, like why I feel good or bad.

## WHY

I am new international student, I leave my home country, new language and new culture.  
Sometimes I feel lonely, and my eating is not good, I eat too much sugar, I sleep too late.  
Sometimes I don't even notice this, it just happen.  
I hear a quote said “you cant grow things you don't measure.”  
So I think I want to grow my emotion, and I make this small program to track how I feel each day.  
If I can see the pattern, maybe I can know what make me happy or not good, and then I can change.

# How to run the program

To start the program in terminal:

pip install -r requirement.txt

python main.py

Some important command:

1. Command + C to exit the code
2. clear to clear the terminal
